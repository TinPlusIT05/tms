BINARY FIELD
============

This module extend the fields class in order to add 2 new type of fields.

- BinaryField
- ImageField

All of this fields will be store on the file system by default and not in the
database. If you want to store it on an other support (database, S3, ftp,
SFTP...)
Then you should create your own 'storage class' and use your custom 'storage
class' instead

The default Storage class will store the field on the file system and build
the path like that

BASE_LOCATION/DB_NAME/MODEL-FIELD/XX/YYYYY

with

    - BASE_LOCATION: Getting from data_dir in config file.
    - DB_NAME:  your database name
    - MODEL-FIELD: the concatenation of the name of the model with the name of the
    field, for example 'product.product-image'
    - XX: the first 2 letter of the file name build with their sha1 hash
    - YYYYYY: file name build with their sha1 hash

Here is an example of field declaration

    'binary_test': fields.BinaryField('Test Binary'),

    'image_test': fields.ImageField('Test Image'),

    'image_test_resize': fields.ImageField(
        resize_base_on='image_test',
        string='Test Image small',
        height=64,
        width=64,
    ),
